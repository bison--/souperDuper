# souperDuper

Duplicate any **soup.io** accounts content

[soup.io](http://soup.io/) is a nice image sharing service but it is verry often down (and/or slow as **HELL**).  
Or imagine you want your soup or the soup of a friend as a screensaver or viewig it offline.
No problem with souperDuper!

## supports:

* multiple account dupeing
* resume: saves progress after every *"page"*

## ToDo:

* order normalisation for new content!
* autogenerated website?
