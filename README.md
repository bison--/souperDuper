# souperDuper

Duplicate any **soup.io** account's content

[soup.io](http://soup.io/) is a nice image sharing service but it is very often down (and/or slow as **HELL**).  
Or imagine you want your soup or the soup of a friend as a screen saver or viewing it offline.
No problem with souperDuper!

## supports:

* multiple account duplication (just start it multiple times ;)
* resume: saves progress after every *"page"*
* specific file types (if you only want all the fancy gifs)

## Installation:

You will need BeautifulSoup.
Depending on your system you can use pip

    pip install BeautifulSoup

or on Debian based systems:

    apt-get install python-beautifulsoup


## Use:

To grab the soup from a user just type:

    readSoup.py SoupUserName

If you only want specific image types:

    readSoup.py SoupUserName imageTypes=png,gif

You also can update all the accounts in the image folder
	
	updateSoup.py 

The program will grep the usernames from the knownUrls.txt files

## ToDo:

* order normalisation for new content!
* autogenerated website?
* better resume (only start where we left!)
